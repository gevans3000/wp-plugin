## Human Testing Requirement
**IMPORTANT:** After each 3-commit cycle, a human must test the plugin via a zipped package in a WordPress environment. Development cannot continue until human provides test results and feedback. This ensures quality and proper functionality in real-world conditions.

## Automatic Execution
**IMPORTANT:** All commands and file edits should be executed automatically without requiring manual confirmation when completing tasks. This ensures efficient workflow and minimizes interruptions during development.
